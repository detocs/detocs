**Note:** DETOCS currently does not queue smash.gg requests to account for their API rate limits, meaning that very large queries will result in errors (instead of being spread out over several minutes).
It should be able to handle major tournaments, but probably not supermajors.
See [this relevant roadmap item](https://github.com/data-enabler/detocs/projects/1#card-50089528).

## Break Tab

Set messages to display on break scenes

## Settings Tab

This tab is currently just used to control a couple of client-side settings.
Reverse the order of the player or commentator fields to whatever feels more natural.
